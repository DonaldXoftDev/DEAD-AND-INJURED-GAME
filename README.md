# Dead and Injured:
----
 Wanna Guess My Secret Numbers? ðŸ˜‰
----
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I cooked up this little brain game in Python called Dead and Injured. It's all about guessing a secret 4-digit number. You take a shot, and I'll tell you how many digits you got right in the right spot ("Dead") and how many are correct but in the wrong place ("Injured"). Then it's my computer's turn to guess your secret number!

Built with some cool Python stuff like:
---
random (for my sneaky secrets!), itertools (for my computer brain!), and prettytable (makes things look nice!).

What I Learned Making This: This was a fun way to play with organizing code into different parts (modules!), making things happen with functions, keeping track of numbers with lists, talking to you through the computer, and even making the computer think a little bit!

Wanna Play Around? Here's how:
----
 * Grab the code: git clone <>
 * Run the main Python file.
 * Just follow what it says on the screen!
Have fun trying to crack the code (and watching my computer try too)! Let me know what you think! ðŸ˜„
