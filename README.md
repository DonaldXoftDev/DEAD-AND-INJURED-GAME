Welcome to my famous game of dead and injured.
This is a childhood game which was initially created in my high school. 
it is a fun game where the  you and the computer both take turns trying to guess each other's 4 digit unique pin from 0 - 9
where a player recieves a feedback from the user in the form '1dead and 2inj'
a 'dead' count is for a number in the player's  guesses which are in the same position as the opponents pin
